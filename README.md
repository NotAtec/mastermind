## Game Description
In this version of mastermind, if you choose to break the code, you must choose from 10 different digits (0 - 9)
You must make a 4 digit code, which is checked for correctness. You will get feedback on how many digits are exactly correct, and how many are in the code, but on the wrong place in your guess.

## Instructions
This game of mastermind is 1-player, and played in the CLI. You can choose to break the code with a **computer generated** code, or to make a code and watch the computer try to take on the challenge*

In both cases, the **code-breaker** has 12 attempts to guess the correct code.

**The computer algorithm isn't that great, so you can probably beat it!*
